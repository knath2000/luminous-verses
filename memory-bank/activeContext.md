## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Create `progress.md` with current project status
2. **Create Implementation Logs**: Set up `raw_reflection_log.md` for continuous improvement
3. **Review Open Tabs**: Analyze planning documents and fix guides that are currently open
4. **Context Window Management**: Monitor token usage (currently at 56%)

### Development Priorities Identified
Based on file names visible in tabs, there are several active development areas:

1. **Audio System Improvements**:
   - Audio playback implementation plans
   - Retry integration for failed audio loads
   - Settings autoplay functionality
   - AudioControls component fixes

2. **Build & Type Issues**:
   - ESLint build error fixes needed
   - TypeScript build error resolution
   - Component integration fixes

3. **Component Enhancements**:
   - ClickableVerseContainer improvements
   - Surah description functionality
   - Expandable text components

### Technical Debt Areas
1. **Missing Configuration Files**: tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.mjs not in main directory
2. **Audio Context**: Referenced in tabs but file not found, needs investigation
3. **Component Dependencies**: Several components reference missing context providers

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions in Progress
1. **Audio Management Strategy**: Pool-based audio with gesture unlock appears well-architected
2. **State Management**: Context + hooks pattern working well, no need for Redux
3. **Styling Approach**: Tailwind + custom CSS variables providing good balance
4. **Component Organization**: Feature-based organization is clear and maintainable

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Spiritual Focus**: All technical decisions support contemplative, child-friendly experience
2. **Performance**: Audio optimization and smooth animations are critical
3. **Accessibility**: High contrast, large touch targets, keyboard navigation
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions

### Integration Challenges
1. **External API Dependency**: Single point of failure for Quran data
2. **Browser Audio Policies**: Complex user gesture requirements for playback
3. **Font Loading**: Arabic typography requires careful optimization
4. **Modal Management**: Complex state management for nested navigation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Conventions
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout, no `any` types
- **Component Design**: Single responsibility, composable interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, memoization, efficient re-renders

### Design Principles
- **Spiritual Respect**: Sacred text handled with appropriate reverence
- **Child-Friendly**: Age-appropriate interactions and visual design
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Authentic Arabic presentation and pronunciation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for inclusive learning

### Code Quality Standards
- **Naming**: Descriptive, intention-revealing component and function names
- **File Organization**: Feature-based grouping with clear dependencies
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic, README for setup
- **Testing Strategy**: Hooks and utilities need unit test coverage (future)

## Learnings & Project Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Visual Design**: Cosmic theme creates magical, engaging atmosphere
2. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns and reusability
3. **API Integration**: Robust fallback handling for external dependencies
4. **Audio System**: Sophisticated handling of browser audio complexities

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Documentation**: Memory bank was incomplete, now being systematized
2. **Error Boundaries**: May need more comprehensive error handling strategies
3. **Testing**: No visible test infrastructure yet (development priority)
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Need metrics for Core Web Vitals optimization

### Key Success Factors
1. **Mission Alignment**: Every technical decision supports spiritual learning goals
2. **User-Centric Design**: Child and family needs drive all interface decisions
3. **Quality Focus**: High standards for performance, accessibility, and beauty
4. **Modern Stack**: Latest React/Next.js features enable advanced functionality
