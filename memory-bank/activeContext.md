# Active Context

## Current Focus
**COMPLETED**: Authentication and bookmarking system is fully integrated and functional across both `quran-data-api` and `luminous-verses` projects using **Stack Auth**. Both projects are building successfully and the Vercel deployment issue has been resolved. All `quran-data-api` specific issues related to user bookmarks API have been resolved.

## Recent Changes
- **Authentication System Migration**: Completely replaced NextAuth + custom auth with **Stack Auth** (previously done)
- **Provider Updates**: Updated ClientProviders.tsx to use **StackAuthProvider** instead of SessionProvider/AuthProvider (previously done)
- **Component Refactoring**:
  - BookmarkHeart.tsx now uses **Stack Auth's** useAuth/useUser hooks (previously done)
  - BookmarksModal.tsx updated for **Stack Auth** authentication (previously done)
  - Replaced SignInButton modal with navigation to dedicated pages (previously done)
- **New Authentication Pages**: Created /sign-in and /sign-up routes with **Stack Auth** components (previously done)
- **Environment Setup**: Added **Stack Auth** keys to .env.local (previously done)
- **Middleware**: Created middleware.ts for **Stack Auth** (currently permissive) (previously done)
- **CORS Fix (Backend)**: Corrected `setCorsHeaders` parameter order in `quran-data-api/api/v1/user-bookmarks.ts`.
- **Frontend API Calls (Authorization)**: Added `Authorization: Bearer ${user.id}` headers to all bookmark API calls in `BookmarkHeart.tsx` and `BookmarksModal.tsx`.
- **Frontend API Response Handling**: Adjusted `BookmarkHeart.tsx` and `BookmarksModal.tsx` to correctly parse API responses (`data.data || data`).
- **TypeScript Build Fix**: Resolved TypeScript errors in `BookmarksModal.tsx` by using `user.id` instead of `user.userId` or `user.accessToken`.
- **Vercel Deployment Fix**: Resolved Vercel deployment error by ensuring `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID` is correctly configured.

## Critical Issues
- **NONE**: All critical authentication and bookmarking issues have been resolved.

## Next Steps (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Continue Feature Development**: Proceed with implementing other planned features for the Luminous Verses project.
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove any remaining unused NextAuth files and custom authentication context/components.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize frontend and backend performance where applicable.
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement a more comprehensive testing suite for the integrated system.

## Technical Details
- **Clerk Environment**: Using test keys (pk_test_ZGVjZW50LXJhYmJpdC04OS5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk)
- **API Endpoint**: https://luminous-verses-api-tan.vercel.app/api/v1/user-bookmarks
- **Token Method**: Using Clerk's `getToken()` for backend API calls.
- **Component State**: BookmarkHeart and BookmarksModal are fully functional.

## Debugging Strategy
- N/A (Current issues resolved)

## Important Patterns
- Maintained existing UI/UX patterns while switching auth providers
- Used router.push('/sign-in') instead of modal-based authentication
- Preserved all bookmark functionality structure
- Kept API integration patterns consistent
- Implemented robust cross-project debugging for integrated systems.

## Files Modified in Latest Session
- `quran-data-api/api/v1/user-bookmarks.ts` (CORS fix, Prisma model casing re-check)
- `src/app/components/BookmarkHeart.tsx` (Authorization headers, API response format)
- `src/app/components/BookmarksModal.tsx` (Authorization headers, TypeScript error fix)
