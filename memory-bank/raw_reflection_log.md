TaskRef: "SettingsModal Component Refactoring"

Learnings:
- Successfully refactored a 350+ line monolithic React component into smaller, reusable components
- Created modular UI components: ToggleSwitch, VolumeSlider, SettingsSection with consistent glass-morphism styling
- Extracted custom hooks for specific concerns: useVolumeControl, useDragInteraction, useModalFocus
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout all new components and hooks
- ESLint configuration properly handles custom hooks with appropriate suppressions for valid patterns

Difficulties:
- Initial TypeScript type mismatch with RefObject<HTMLElement> vs RefObject<HTMLElement | null> in useDragInteraction hook
- ESLint warnings for variables assigned but not used in hooks designed for future extensibility

Successes:
- Clean separation of concerns with each component having a single responsibility
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Maintainable code structure that follows React best practices
- All components are now easily testable and reusable across the application
- Build passes with zero errors and proper linting

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Component abstraction pattern: Extract complex UI logic into reusable components
- Custom hooks pattern: Separate stateful logic from presentation logic
- TypeScript generics usage: Proper typing for flexible, reusable components

TaskRef: "Performance Optimization: Centralized Surah Name Fetching & Console Log Removal"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented a custom React hook `useSurahNames` to centralize the fetching and caching of surah names, resolving the N+1 query problem for surah names in the virtualized list.
- Integrated `useSurahNames` into `VerseItem.tsx` and `VerseListContainer.tsx` to ensure all surah name lookups are handled efficiently.
- Removed all `console.log` statements from `VerseItem.tsx` and `VerseListContainer.tsx` for cleaner code and minor performance improvements.
- Addressed React Hooks rules violations by ensuring `useCallback` hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of the component.

Difficulties:
- Initial `useCallback` placement in `VerseListContainer.tsx` caused React Hooks rules violations due to conditional calls. This was resolved by moving the hook definitions to the top of the component.
- Ensuring `surahNames` was correctly passed down through `itemData` to `VerseItem.tsx`.

Successes:
- Eliminated redundant API calls for surah names, significantly improving the performance of the virtualized verse list.
- Cleaned up codebase by removing debugging `console.log` statements.
- Maintained a successful build after all changes, confirming no new errors were introduced.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Centralized data fetching and caching for common, repeatedly accessed data (e.g., `useSurahNames` for surah names).
- Best Practice: Always ensure React Hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of functional components.

TaskRef: "Project Analysis, UI/UX Refinements, and Bug Fixes"

Learnings:
- **Project Architecture:** Gained a comprehensive understanding of `luminous-verses` (Next.js/React frontend) and `quran-data-api` (Vercel Node.js/Prisma/PostgreSQL backend) and their direct client-server interaction via `quranApi.ts`.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - Successfully removed all hover effects (scaling, shadow, border changes, gradient overlay, audio readiness hint) from `ClickableVerseContainer.tsx` and `VerseItem.tsx`.
    - Relocated the "back button" in `SurahListModal.tsx` from inside the modal to its middle-left side, outside the modal's DOM tree, using `absolute` positioning within the portal's main container.
    - Restored the backdrop dimming effect for the surah list modal by correctly structuring the backdrop, modal, and back button within the `createPortal`'s outermost `div` and managing `pointer-events`.
- **New Feature Implementation:** Implemented bookmarking functionality via long press/click on verse cards in `ClickableVerseContainer.tsx`, integrating with Stack Auth for user identification and the backend API for bookmark storage.
- **Debugging & Error Resolution:**
    - Resolved TypeScript errors related to missing props (`verseText`, `surahName`, `translation`) after modifying `ClickableVerseContainerProps`.
    - Corrected `AuthModal` import type from named to default export.
    - Fixed ESLint warning in `ClickableVerseContainer.tsx` by adding `handleBookmark` to `useCallback` dependencies and reordering function declarations.
    - Fixed unescaped apostrophe (`'`) JSX error in `VerseOfTheDay.tsx` by replacing it with `'`.
    - **Crucially, identified and resolved the CORS preflight (OPTIONS) 401 Unauthorized error:** The `withAuth` middleware in `quran-data-api` was attempting authentication on OPTIONS requests. This was fixed by adding a bypass for OPTIONS requests at the very beginning of the `withAuth` middleware.

Difficulties:
- Initial attempts to remove hover effects via `search_and_replace` were insufficient, requiring a full `write_to_file` for `ClickableVerseContainer.tsx` and `VerseItem.tsx`.
- Debugging the back button positioning required multiple iterations and a deeper understanding of `fixed`, `absolute`, `flex`, and `padding` interactions in Tailwind CSS within a React Portal context.
- The CORS preflight issue was subtle, requiring knowledge of how authentication middleware interacts with OPTIONS requests and Vercel's deployment environment.
- Managing `useCallback` dependencies when functions depend on each other required careful reordering of function declarations.
- Persistent unescaped apostrophe error required targeted replacement.

Successes:
- Achieved a comprehensive understanding of both `luminous-verses` and `quran-data-api` projects and their interaction.
- Successfully implemented all requested UI/UX changes and new features (long press bookmarking).
- Resolved all encountered TypeScript, ESLint, and runtime errors, including complex CORS issues.
- Maintained successful builds for both frontend and backend projects throughout the process.
- Enhanced user experience by removing distracting hover effects and providing intuitive bookmarking.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- **Pattern: Robust CORS Handling for Authenticated APIs:** Always ensure CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests are handled *before* any authentication middleware, returning `200 OK` with appropriate `Access-Control-*` headers.
- **Pattern: Long Press Gesture Implementation:** Use `onMouseDown`/`onTouchStart` with a timer and `onMouseUp`/`onTouchEnd`/`onMouseLeave` to clear the timer, preventing `onClick` on long presses.
- **Best Practice: React Hooks Dependency Arrays:** Be meticulous with `useCallback` and `useEffect` dependency arrays, ensuring all external values used within the hook are included, and reorder function declarations if necessary to avoid 'used before declaration' errors.
- **Best Practice: Modal Positioning in Portals:** For elements outside a modal's DOM but visually related, use `absolute` positioning within the `createPortal`'s outermost container, and manage `pointer-events` to control clickability.
- **Debugging Strategy: Systematic Error Resolution:** When encountering multiple errors, address them one by one, starting with the most fundamental (e.g., import errors, then prop errors, then logic errors), and re-run builds frequently.
