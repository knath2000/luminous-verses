TaskRef: "Critical Audio Pause/Resume Bug Fix"

Learnings:
- Successfully identified and resolved critical audio pause/resume bug that was causing audio to restart from beginning instead of resuming from paused position
- Root cause was in the audioReducer function in AudioContext.tsx with multiple issues:
  1. SET_PAUSED action was using `action.paused ?? false` instead of `action.paused ?? true`
  2. SET_PLAYING action was always setting `isPaused: false`, overriding pause state
  3. stop() function wasn't properly resetting audio references
- Fixed audioReducer logic:
  - SET_PAUSED now defaults to `true` and preserves pause state correctly
  - SET_PLAYING only clears `isPaused` when actually starting to play (`isPaused: action.playing ? false : state.isPaused`)
  - SET_ERROR now properly resets `isPaused` to `false` on errors
- Enhanced stop() function to reset currentVerseRef, startTimeRef, and pauseTimeRef
- Console logs confirmed the fix: `isPaused` now correctly shows `true` after pause

Difficulties:
- Initial debugging showed state management issue but required careful analysis of reducer logic
- Multiple interconnected state issues needed to be addressed simultaneously
- Required understanding of Web Audio API timing and React state management interaction

Successes:
- Audio now properly pauses and resumes from correct position
- State management works correctly with proper `isPaused: true` after pause
- Resume logic properly triggered when tapping paused verse
- User experience now seamless for pause/resume functionality
- Build compiles successfully with all fixes

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- React reducer debugging pattern: Check default values in action handlers (`?? false` vs `?? true`)
- Audio state management: Preserve pause state when not actively playing
- Web Audio API: Proper cleanup of references in stop() function
- State debugging: Console logs at multiple points to track state transitions

TaskRef: "Audio Pause/Resume Implementation Attempt"

Learnings:
- Audio system was restarting playback from beginning instead of resuming from paused position
- Successfully identified the core issue through console log analysis
- Implemented comprehensive pause/resume functionality including:
  - Added 'resume' event to AudioEvent type
  - Added resume() method to AudioControls interface
  - Implemented resume function in AudioContext that creates new audio nodes from paused position
  - Enhanced useVerseAudio hook with intelligent play/pause/resume logic
  - Fixed pause time calculation to properly accumulate playback time
- Added extensive logging for debugging state transitions

Difficulties:
- Critical issue discovered: `isPaused` state not being set to `true` after pause action
- Console logs show: `isCurrentVerse: true, isPlaying: false, isPaused: false`
- This causes resume logic to be bypassed and playback restarts from beginning
- The pause function calls `dispatch({ type: 'SET_PAUSED', paused: true })` but state doesn't update
- Possible timing issue or audioReducer implementation problem

Successes:
- Correctly identified the root cause through systematic debugging
- Implemented proper pause time calculation logic
- Added comprehensive state logging for future debugging
- Build compiles successfully with all new functionality

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- State management debugging techniques - importance of logging state at multiple points
- Audio Web API pause/resume patterns require careful state coordination
- React state reducer debugging - verify action handling in reducer functions
- Need to check audioReducer SET_PAUSED case implementation tomorrow

Next_Steps:
1. Check audioReducer SET_PAUSED case implementation
2. Verify state update timing and propagation
3. Add debugging to track state changes in reducer
4. Test state updates in isolation
5. Ensure pause state persists correctly for resume logic

Learnings:
- Successfully resolved ESLint build errors in SurahDescription.tsx:
  - Removed unused `SurahDescriptionData` import that was causing no-unused-vars error
  - Fixed `as any` type assertion by using proper union type `'overview' | 'themes' | 'context'`
- Implemented proper API integration for Surah descriptions:
  - Discovered correct API endpoint: `https://luminous-verses-api-tan.vercel.app/api/v1/get-surah-description?surahId={id}`
  - Parameter name is `surahId` (with capital I), not `surah` or `surahid`
  - API returns structured data with `description` and `surahInfo` objects
  - Successfully mapped API response to internal `SurahDescriptionData` interface
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallback strategy:
  - Primary: Try API call first for fresh data
  - Secondary: Fall back to local fallback data if API fails
  - Tertiary: Create basic description as last resort

Difficulties:
- Initial API testing showed parameter name confusion (surah vs surahid vs surahId)
- Had to test multiple parameter variations to find the correct endpoint format
- Browser testing revealed the correct parameter name through trial and error

Successes:
- Clean ESLint build with no warnings or errors
- Robust API integration with multiple fallback layers
- Enhanced user experience with real-time Surah information from API
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing fallback data

TaskRef: "Duplicate Autoplay Event Listener Fix - Architectural Component Duplication Resolution"

Learnings:
- **Root Cause Discovery**: The pause/resume corruption was caused by **architectural duplication** - two separate components both calling `useAutoplay()` simultaneously:
  1. `AutoplayManager` in `layout.tsx` (global autoplay manager)
  2. `ConditionalAutoplay` in `SurahListModal.tsx` (modal-specific autoplay)
- This created two independent instances of the autoplay hook, each with their own event listeners, causing duplicate audio events
- **Memoization Approach Limitation**: Initial attempt to fix with `useMemo` on `controls` object in AudioContext was insufficient because the real issue was multiple hook instances, not object recreation
- **Component Architecture Pattern**: Single global manager pattern is superior to multiple competing instances for event-driven systems
- **Debugging Methodology**: Console log analysis showing duplicate "Audio ended event received" messages was key to identifying the architectural issue
- **Event Listener Management**: React's dependency system detecting "changes" in objects that were functionally identical but different references caused constant re-setup of event listeners

Difficulties:
- Initial memoization fix didn't resolve the issue, requiring deeper architectural analysis
- Multiple components calling the same hook created competing event listeners that were difficult to trace
- Console logs showed duplicate events but initial focus was on object reference stability rather than component duplication
- Required systematic search through codebase to find all instances of `useAutoplay()` usage

Successes:
- Successfully identified and eliminated duplicate component architecture
- Consolidated to single global `AutoplayManager` pattern for clean event handling
- Removed unused `ConditionalAutoplay` component and cleaned up codebase
- Fixed pause/resume corruption issue completely - pause button now works correctly
- Build compiles successfully with no errors after cleanup
- User experience now seamless: verse plays → pause works → resume works → auto-advance works → pause still works

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- **Architectural Pattern**: Single global manager for event-driven systems vs. multiple competing instances
- **Component Duplication Detection**: Search for duplicate hook usage when debugging event listener issues
- **React Hook Architecture**: Multiple instances of the same hook create independent state and event listeners
- **Event System Debugging**: Look for architectural duplication when seeing duplicate event logs
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Remove unused components completely rather than leaving dead code
- **Build Verification**: Always run build after architectural changes to ensure clean compilation

Technical_Implementation_Details:
- Removed `ConditionalAutoplay` component from `SurahListModal.tsx`
- Deleted `src/app/components/ConditionalAutoplay.tsx` file entirely
- Kept single global `AutoplayManager` in `layout.tsx` as the sole autoplay manager
- Memoized `controls` object in `AudioContext` for stability (supporting fix)
- Fixed React hook dependency arrays for proper cleanup

Expected_Behavior_Verified:
- Single "Setting up audio ended event listener" log instead of duplicates
- Single "Audio ended event received" per verse end instead of duplicates
- Pause button properly pauses audio (no new playback triggered)
- Resume button continues from correct position
- Auto-advance works smoothly between verses
- Pause functionality remains working after auto-advance

Architecture_Lesson:
- Event-driven systems require single source of truth for event management
- Multiple components managing the same functionality independently creates race conditions
- Global managers are preferable to modal-specific managers for cross-component functionality
