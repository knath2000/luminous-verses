TaskRef: "SettingsModal Component Refactoring"

Learnings:
- Successfully refactored a 350+ line monolithic React component into smaller, reusable components
- Created modular UI components: ToggleSwitch, VolumeSlider, SettingsSection with consistent glass-morphism styling
- Extracted custom hooks for specific concerns: useVolumeControl, useDragInteraction, useModalFocus
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout all new components and hooks
- ESLint configuration properly handles custom hooks with appropriate suppressions for valid patterns

Difficulties:
- Initial TypeScript type mismatch with RefObject<HTMLElement> vs RefObject<HTMLElement | null> in useDragInteraction hook
- ESLint warnings for variables assigned but not used in hooks designed for future extensibility

Successes:
- Clean separation of concerns with each component having a single responsibility
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Maintainable code structure that follows React best practices
- All components are now easily testable and reusable across the application
- Build passes with zero errors and proper linting

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Component abstraction pattern: Extract complex UI logic into reusable components
- Custom hooks pattern: Separate stateful logic from presentation logic
- TypeScript generics usage: Proper typing for flexible, reusable components

TaskRef: "Performance Optimization: Centralized Surah Name Fetching & Console Log Removal"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented a custom React hook `useSurahNames` to centralize the fetching and caching of surah names, resolving the N+1 query problem for surah names in the virtualized list.
- Integrated `useSurahNames` into `VerseItem.tsx` and `VerseListContainer.tsx` to ensure all surah name lookups are handled efficiently.
- Removed all `console.log` statements from `VerseItem.tsx` and `VerseListContainer.tsx` for cleaner code and minor performance improvements.
- Addressed React Hooks rules violations by ensuring `useCallback` hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of the component.

Difficulties:
- Initial `useCallback` placement in `VerseListContainer.tsx` caused React Hooks rules violations due to conditional calls. This was resolved by moving the hook definitions to the top of the component.
- Ensuring `surahNames` was correctly passed down through `itemData` to `VerseItem.tsx`.

Successes:
- Eliminated redundant API calls for surah names, significantly improving the performance of the virtualized verse list.
- Cleaned up codebase by removing debugging `console.log` statements.
- Maintained a successful build after all changes, confirming no new errors were introduced.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Centralized data fetching and caching for common, repeatedly accessed data (e.g., `useSurahNames` for surah names).
- Best Practice: Always ensure React Hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of functional components.
