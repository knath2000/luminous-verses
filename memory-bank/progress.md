## ðŸ”„ Current Status

### Recently Completed (January 9, 2025)
- âœ… **CRITICAL BUG FIX: Duplicate Autoplay Event Listener Resolution**: Fixed pause/resume corruption by eliminating architectural component duplication
  - **Root Cause**: Two components (`AutoplayManager` and `ConditionalAutoplay`) both calling `useAutoplay()` created competing event listeners
  - **Solution**: Removed duplicate `ConditionalAutoplay` component, consolidated to single global `AutoplayManager` pattern
  - **Result**: Pause/resume functionality now works correctly, no more duplicate audio events
  - **Architecture Lesson**: Event-driven systems require single source of truth for event management
  - **User Experience**: Audio controls now work reliably - pause pauses, resume resumes, autoplay works correctly
  - **Build Quality**: Clean compilation with no unused components or TypeScript errors

- âœ… **MAJOR FEATURE: SurahListModal UX Enhancement**: Modern floating navigation and state persistence
  - **Research Phase**: Used Context7 and Perplexity Research MCP tools to study modal UX best practices
  - **Header Removal**: Eliminated cluttered header section for cleaner, more spacious interface
  - **Floating Navigation**: Implemented research-based floating back button positioned halfway down modal
  - **Backdrop Click Fix**: Resolved non-functional backdrop click-to-close behavior
  - **State Persistence**: Modal now maintains exact state across close/reopen cycles
  - **Accessibility**: 48x48px touch targets, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
  - **Visual Design**: Subtle grayed-out default state with gold hover effects and smooth animations
  - **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation that follows modern app patterns and user expectations

- âœ… **PREVIOUS: Settings & Autoplay System Implementation**: Complete settings system with autoplay functionality
  - **Phase 1 - Settings UI**: Created SettingsButton and SettingsModal components with glass morphism design
  - **Phase 2 - Autoplay Logic**: Implemented intelligent autoplay system with useAutoplay hook
  - **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved manual pause triggering autoplay and excessive re-renders
  - **AudioContext Enhancement**: Added manual stop detection to prevent incorrect autoplay triggers
  - **User Experience**: Seamless settings access with toggle controls and smooth autoplay transitions
  - **System Integration**: Full integration with existing audio system and state management
  - **Build Quality**: All TypeScript and ESLint errors resolved, clean production build
  - **Testing Verified**: User confirmed autoplay works correctly and respects manual pause actions

- âœ… **PREVIOUS: Audio Pause/Resume Bug Fix**: Successfully resolved major audio playback issue
  - Fixed audioReducer logic in AudioContext.tsx that was preventing proper pause state management
