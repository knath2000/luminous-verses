- ❌ User progress tracking
- ❌ Personalized reading history
- ❌ Social sharing features
- ❌ Offline reading capability
- ❌ Search functionality within verses

- ❌ Multiple translation comparisons
- ❌ Tafsir (commentary) integration
- ❌ Prayer time integration
- ❌ Qibla direction feature

## Current Status
**Phase**: Authentication Integration (CRITICAL ISSUE)
**Priority**: URGENT - Authentication completely broken

### Authentication Migration Status
- ✅ Clerk package installed and configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up
- ✅ ClerkProvider integrated into app
- ✅ Sign-in/sign-up pages created
- ✅ Components updated to use Clerk hooks
- ✅ Middleware configured
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Sign-in button not responding
- ❌ Authentication flow completely broken
- ❌ Users cannot bookmark verses
- ❌ No error messages or debugging info

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Sign-in Modal Not Appearing**: BookmarkHeart component's authentication trigger is silent
2. **No Console Errors**: Makes debugging difficult
3. **Untested Integration**: Clerk setup may have configuration issues
4. **API Token Compatibility**: Unknown if Clerk tokens work with existing backend

## Known Issues
- **CRITICAL**: Authentication system completely non-functional
- Some audio files may have loading delays
- Scroll position restoration could be improved
- Need better error handling for network issues

## Technical Debt
- **URGENT**: Debug and fix Clerk authentication
- Remove unused NextAuth files after Clerk migration
- Clean up custom auth context and components
- Optimize bundle size
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Improve accessibility features
- Add comprehensive testing suite

## Next Session Priority
1. **Debug authentication flow** - Add logging and test each step
2. **Test dedicated auth pages** - Verify /sign-in route works
3. **Validate Clerk configuration** - Check provider setup and environment
4. **Test API integration** - Ensure Clerk tokens work with backend
5. **Complete bookmark functionality** - End-to-end testing
