# Luminous Verses - Development Progress

## 🚀 **Recently Completed (Current Session)**

### **Verse-Pill Tokens & Grid Upgrade ✅**
- **Design Tokens Added**: Introduced `--pill-surface-*`, `--shadow-level-*` CSS vars in `globals.css` for consistent glass surfaces and depth tiers.
- **Motion Keyframes**: Added `hoverLift`, `activeSquash`, and `sparkleBurst` keyframes + Tailwind animations for rich micro-interactions.
- **Reusable Component**: Created `VersePill.tsx` with accessibility (`aria-label`, `aria-current`, keyboard focus ring) and reduced-motion fallbacks.
- **Global Integration**: Replaced old inline verse buttons in `JumpToVerseModal.tsx` and `SearchableVerseGrid.tsx` with `VersePill`, ensuring design-system consistency across both virtualised and non-virtualised grids.
- **Theming Flexibility**: Exposed CSS custom properties and utility classes, paving the way for future theme customisation without component rewrites.
- **Performance & DX**: Removed `clsx` dependency by using lightweight `cx` helper; zero bundle size impact and simpler builds.

  - Added floating gradient orbs and sparkle micro-interactions

- **✅ Glassmorphism Implementation**
  - Applied `.glass-morphism-dark` for consistent backdrop blur effects
  - Used established color tokens: gold (#fbbf24), purple tones, white opacity variants
  - Implemented proper contrast ratios following [NN/g glassmorphism guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/)
  - Added layered depth with floating orbs and shadow effects

- **✅ Interactive Enhancements**
  - Added hover animations with scale transforms (scale-110) and smooth transitions
