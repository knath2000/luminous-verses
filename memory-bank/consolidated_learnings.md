# Consolidated Learnings: Luminous Verses

## Settings & Autoplay System Implementation

### Autoplay Event Handling
**Pattern: Distinguishing Natural vs Manual Audio Stops**
- Use a ref flag (`isManuallyStoppedRef`) to track whether audio was stopped manually or naturally
- Set the flag to `true` in `pause()`, `stop()`, and `seek()` functions before calling `source.stop()`
- Only emit 'ended' events for natural completions, not manual stops
- Reset the flag after each `onended` callback to prepare for next playback
- *Rationale:* Prevents autoplay from triggering when user manually pauses audio, which would be unexpected behavior

### React Hook Optimization for Event Listeners
**Pattern: Stable Dependencies for useEffect**
- Use `useCallback` with stable dependencies for event handlers
- Avoid including frequently changing values in effect dependencies
- Use refs for values that need to persist but shouldn't trigger re-renders
- Implement deduplication logic to prevent processing same events multiple times
- *Rationale:* Prevents excessive event listener setup/teardown cycles that cause performance issues

### Settings Modal Implementation
**Pattern: React Portal with Accessibility**
- Use React Portal to render modals outside the normal DOM hierarchy
- Implement proper focus management (focus trap, return focus on close)
- Add keyboard navigation support (Escape to close, Tab navigation)
- Use ARIA labels and roles for screen reader accessibility
- Include backdrop click handling for intuitive UX
- *Rationale:* Proper modal implementation ensures accessibility compliance and good user experience

### Toggle Component Design
**Pattern: Custom Toggle Switches**
- Create reusable toggle components with consistent styling
- Implement proper state management with controlled components
- Add visual feedback for state changes (smooth transitions)
- Ensure keyboard accessibility (Space/Enter to toggle)
- Use semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes
- *Rationale:* Custom toggles provide better design control while maintaining accessibility

### Autoplay Logic Architecture
**Pattern: Event-Driven Sequential Playback**
- Listen to audio 'ended' events rather than polling audio state
- Fetch surah metadata to calculate verse counts dynamically
- Implement intelligent next verse calculation with boundary checking
- Add graceful handling for end-of-surah scenarios
- Include user preference checking before triggering autoplay
- *Rationale:* Event-driven approach is more efficient and responsive than polling-based solutions
## React Development Best Practices

### Component Architecture for Event Systems
**Pattern: Single Global Manager vs. Multiple Competing Instances**
- Event-driven systems require single source of truth for event management to prevent duplicate listeners
- Multiple components calling the same hook (e.g., `useAutoplay()`) create independent instances with competing event listeners
- Global managers (e.g., `AutoplayManager` in layout) are superior to modal-specific managers for cross-component functionality
- Architectural duplication causes race conditions and unexpected behavior (e.g., pause triggering new playback)
- *Rationale:* Single global manager pattern ensures clean event handling and prevents competing audio streams

### useEffect Dependency Management
**Pattern: Complete Dependency Arrays**
- Always include all dependencies referenced inside useEffect hooks to prevent infinite loops
- Missing dependencies in useEffect can cause browser crashes and poor user experience
- Example fix: Adding `[isOpen]` dependency array to SurahListModal useEffect
- *Rationale:* Prevents infinite re-renders and maintains component lifecycle integrity

### Component State Lifecycle
**Pattern: Proper Cleanup and Effect Management**
- Modal components require careful state management for visibility and data fetching
- Implement proper cleanup patterns in useEffect hooks
- Monitor for infinite loops and high CPU usage patterns during development
- *Rationale:* Ensures smooth user experience and prevents performance degradation

### Debugging Event Listener Issues
**Pattern: Architectural Duplication Detection**
- When seeing duplicate event logs, search for multiple components using the same hook
- Console logs showing duplicate "Audio ended event received" indicate competing event listeners
- Object reference stability (useMemo) may not solve the issue if the problem is architectural duplication
- Systematic codebase search for hook usage patterns reveals architectural issues
- *Rationale:* Event listener problems often stem from component architecture rather than object recreation

## Audio System Architecture

### Browser Audio Policy Compliance
**Pattern: User Gesture Detection and Audio Unlock**
- Web Audio API requires user gesture before audio playback (especially iOS Safari)
- Implement UserGestureContext to track first user interaction
- Use audio unlock utilities to handle cross-browser compatibility
- *Rationale:* Ensures audio functionality works across all browsers and devices

### Audio Pool Management
**Pattern: Resource Optimization for Audio Instances**
- Implement audio instance pooling to prevent memory leaks
- Reuse audio elements rather than creating new ones for each playback
- Include comprehensive cleanup and error recovery mechanisms
- *Rationale:* Optimizes performance and prevents browser memory issues with multiple audio files

## Memory Bank System Effectiveness

### Documentation Continuity Protocol
**Pattern: Systematic Knowledge Preservation**
- Memory bank system successfully maintains project knowledge across sessions
- Comprehensive documentation enables rapid project comprehension after context resets

## API Integration Patterns

### Luminous Verses API Structure
**Base URL:** `https://luminous-verses-api-tan.vercel.app/api/v1`

**Key Endpoints:**
- `/get-surah-description?surahId={id}` - Comprehensive surah metadata with scholarly descriptions
- `/get-metadata?type=surah-list` - Complete list of all 114 surahs with metadata
- `/get-verses?surah={number}` - Arabic verses for a specific surah
- `/get-translated-verse?surah={number}&ayah={number}&translator=en.yusufali` - Individual verse with Yusuf Ali translation

**Response Patterns:**
- Surah descriptions include: Arabic name, transliteration, English name, scholarly description, metadata (verses count, revelation type, chronological order)
- Verse translations provide: Arabic text, English translation, verse positioning data
- Metadata endpoints return structured arrays with consistent field naming

### Translation Integration Best Practices
**Pattern: Unified API Utility**
- Create centralized API utility (`quranApi.ts`) for all external data fetching
- Implement intelligent caching with configurable duration (5 minutes proven effective)
- Use TypeScript generics for type-safe caching: `getCachedData<T>(key: string): T | null`
- Provide fallback data for critical functionality (Al-Fatiha, popular verses)

**Verse of the Day Implementation:**
- Use deterministic selection based on date for consistency
- Rotate through curated list of meaningful verses
- Always include both Arabic text and English translation
- Handle API failures gracefully with fallback verses

**Translation Quality:**
- Yusuf Ali translation provides authentic, scholarly English text
- API parameter: `translator=en.yusufali` (required field)
- Maintain attribution to translation source
- Consider future support for multiple translation options

### TypeScript API Integration
**Critical Pattern: Proper Type Safety**
- Define strict interfaces for all API responses
- Use generic types for caching systems: `function getCachedData<T>(key: string): T | null`
- Avoid `any` types - use `unknown` and proper type assertions
- Implement proper error typing for async operations
- Cache interface: `interface CacheEntry { data: unknown; timestamp: number; }`

**API Response Mapping:**
- Map external API structure to internal interfaces consistently
- Handle optional fields with proper defaults
- Validate response structure before processing
- Provide meaningful error messages for malformed data

### API Caching Strategy
**Pattern: Intelligent Response Caching**
- 5-minute cache duration balances freshness with performance
- Map-based caching with timestamp validation: `Map<string, CacheEntry>`
- Generic cache functions support multiple data types
- Cache keys should include all relevant parameters (surah, verse, translator)
- Automatic cache cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
interface CacheEntry {
  data: unknown;
  timestamp: number;
}

function getCachedData<T>(key: string): T | null {
  const entry = cache.get(key);
  if (entry && Date.now() - entry.timestamp < CACHE_DURATION) {
    return entry.data as T;
  }
  cache.delete(key);
  return null;
}
```

### API Integration Lessons Learned
**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Documentation First**: Always check API documentation before implementation
2. **Parameter Validation**: Verify required parameters (surah, ayah, translator)
3. **Response Structure**: Understand API response format before mapping to interfaces
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Caching Strategy**: Balance performance with data freshness through intelligent caching
6. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript generics for reusable, type-safe utilities

### Error Handling Strategy
- Always implement graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Cache successful responses to reduce API calls
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Maintain app functionality even when API is unavailable
## Modal UX & Floating Navigation

**Pattern: Research-Driven UX Development**
- Use MCP tools (Context7, Perplexity Research) for UX research and design validation before implementation
- Research-based design decisions produce significantly better user experiences than assumption-based approaches
- *Rationale:* Evidence-based design reduces guesswork and aligns with established UX patterns and user expectations

**Pattern: Floating Navigation Implementation**

- Implement 48x48px minimum touch targets for WCAG accessibility compliance
- Use subtle default states (opacity-30, grayed colors) that become prominent on interaction
- Apply smooth transitions and hover effects for better user feedback
- *Rationale:* Floating elements provide navigation without cluttering the interface, while accessibility ensures inclusive design

**Pattern: Modal State Persistence**
- Remove automatic state reset logic from useEffect cleanup functions to maintain user context
- Preserve currentView, selectedSurah, and UI state across modal close/reopen cycles
- Allow users to pick up exactly where they left off in their exploration
- *Rationale:* Modern users expect app-like behavior where context is maintained across interactions, improving task completion rates

**Pattern: Backdrop Click Implementation**
- Add `onClick={onClose}` to modal container div for click-outside-to-close behavior
- Use `onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}` on modal content to prevent unwanted closes
- Implement proper event handling hierarchy for intuitive modal interactions
- *Rationale:* Click-outside-to-close is an expected modal interaction pattern that improves usability when properly implemented

**Pattern: Clean Interface Design**
- Remove unnecessary header sections and visual clutter to maximize content space
- Integrate titles and navigation elements directly into scrollable content areas
- Use conditional rendering for navigation elements (show only when needed)
- *Rationale:* Clean interfaces improve focus on primary content and create more spacious, modern user experiences
